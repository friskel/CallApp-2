    <string name="about_page_paragraph">I made this app to help people succeed in their corrections programs. After going through one myself, I learned that it can be hard to keep track of your daily call-ins each and every day, even with standard alarms set on your phone.. and it really sucks to get in trouble for not calling in. I know from experience that being on probation and other court-ordered supervision can be a stressful time in your life, and hopefully this app can help out some. \n</string>
