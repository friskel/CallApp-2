# Probation Buddy

Daily reminders for people on probation, parole, or any other court supervision to make their daily call-in to check if they have to go take a random drug test.  Allows you to call with one click of the notification and keeps reminding you if you haven't called yet that day.  If you are required to test, you can start reminders to make sure you don't forget to go.
